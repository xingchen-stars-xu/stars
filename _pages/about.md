About Me
======
Hello! My name is Xingchen Xu, but you can call me Stars. My English name, Stars, is a direct translation of my Chinese name "Xingchen". I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Engineering Education Systems and Design at Arizona State University, where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Li Tan](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4426391).

Before starting graduate school, I completed my bachelor's degree in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. My background in psychology helps me in my current research, where I focus on improving how engineering is taught and learned.
