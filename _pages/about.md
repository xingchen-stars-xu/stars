About Me
======
Hello! My name is Xingchen Xu, but you can call me Stars. My English name, Stars, is a direct translation of my Chinese name "Xingchen". I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Engineering Education Systems and Design at Arizona State University, where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Li Tan](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4426391).

Before starting graduate school, I completed my bachelor's degree in Developmental Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. My background in psychology helps me in my current research, where I focus on improving how engineering is taught and learned.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
